CS50's **PSET4** in C language..
The idea of the problem is to create a program that **load**s a dictionary , enters words into ***hash*** function to separate words into 26 parts of hashtable , then loads a text file to compare it's words to the dictionary's hashtable to check if the word is spelled correctly or not .. then it unloads the hashtable by free it from the memory.
The program *should* have a quick algorithm as a challenge to do the fontionallity as fast as possiple .
